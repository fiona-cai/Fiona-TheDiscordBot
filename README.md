# Fiona-TheDiscordBot
Discord Bot I made when I was in grade 7-8. I have not updated it since.

(Left out main some files that are quite personal LOL)

For more than a year I worked on this every week, adding new features as I went. My experience with programming basically started here and I've fallen in love since.

I still remember the moment I first got the bot to send a message in server with my elementary school friends. Back then, the whole friend group was making bots, and it was almost like a competition haha.

Somehow this bot actually lived quite a life and got into many servers -- for a while it was quite literally Fiona 2.0 because I'd add it to every server I was in. 

On 07/10/2021, I ran a command and saw that it had 35996 users; and it was like the coolest thing ever

Now obviously, the code is like... quite messy. When I first started making it everything was in one huge Python file called bot.py and it had like 3000+ which I guess looking back isn't thaaaat much but as I continued to work on it, I started using more and more files.

Literally, when I started, I couldn't even make a command line BMI calculator and by the end of it I was making clever stuff like using custom emojis to generate "block art" by analyzing the brightness of a group of pixels.

Other times, I'd make what I wish already existed.

Back before high school I was really into digital art and Instagram wasn't giving me the attention I wanted. This was before reels and all the new stuff. So I kinda created my own social media within the bot which is so funny cuz it's like social media in social media.

My friends all created their own "gallery" and you could like them and browse through everything.

I was also a sucker for winning games.

aaand so I took a lot of inspiration from someone else's code and made a sudoku solver

I have to say though, my favourite moment from Fiona was when I made this chatbot function with the chatterbot module THIS WAS BEFORE CHATGPT and my friends liked to train the bot for me so they'd kinda message it for fun for hours on end. One day I directed the bot away from that and instead my friends were texting me... except it would look like the bot was texting. Fun times, fun times (they almost didn't notice)

I basically tried everything in the coding world that I could with this bot and even though it is very much imperfect, I think it's time that I kinda put it here and stop feeling ashamed from that :)

very important part of my coding journey!!
